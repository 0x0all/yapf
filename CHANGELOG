## [0.6.0] UNRELEASED
### Added
- Add knob to indent the dictionary value if there is a split before it.

### Fixed
- When determining if we should split a dictionary's value to a new line, use
  the longest entry instead of the total dictionary's length. This allows the
  formatter to reformat the dictionary in a more consistent manner.
- Improve how list comprehensions are formatted. Make splitting dependent upon
  whether the "comp_for" or "comp_if" goes over the column limit.
- Don't over indent if expression hanging indents if we expect to dedent the
  closing bracket.
- Improve splitting heuristic when the first argument to a function call is
  itself a function call with arguments. In cases like this, the remaining
  arguments to the function call would look badly aligned, even though they are
  techincally correct (the best kind of correct!).
- Improve splitting heuristic more so that if the first argument to a function
  call is a data literal that will go over the column limit, then we want to
  split before it.
- Remove spaces around '**' operator.
- Retain formatting of comments in the middle of an expression.

## [0.5.0] 2015-10-11
### Added
- Add option to exclude files/directories from formatting.
- Add a knob to control whether import names are split after the first '('.

### Fixed
- Indent the continuation of an if-then statement when it's not distinguished
  from the body of the if-then.
- Allow for sensible splitting of array indices where appropriate.
- Prefer to not split before the ending bracket of an atom. This produces
  better code in most cases.
- Corrected how horizontal spaces were presevered in a disabled region.

## [0.4.0] 2015-10-07
### Added
- Support for dedenting closing brackets, "facebook" style.

### Fixed
- Formatting of tokens after a multiline string didn't retain their horizontal
  spacing.

## [0.3.1] 2015-09-30
### Fixed
- Format closing scope bracket correctly when indentation size changes.

## [0.3.0] 2015-09-20
### Added
- Return a 2 if the source changed, 1 on error, and 0 for no change.

### Fixed
- Make sure we format if the "lines" specified are in the middle of a
  statement.

## [0.2.9] - 2015-09-13
### Fixed
- Formatting of multiple files. It was halting after formatting the first file.

## [0.2.8] - 2015-09-12
### Added
- Return a non-zero exit code if the source was changed.
- Add bitwise operator splitting penalty and prefer to split before bitwise
  operators.

### Fixed
- Retain vertical spacing between disabled and enabled lines.
- Split only at start of named assign.
- Retain comment position when formatting is disabled.
- Honor splitting before or after logical ops.
